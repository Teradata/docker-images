# 1) Change VERSION to a non-SNAPSHOT release: 35-SNAPSHOT -> 35
# 2) Commit the repo
# 3) `make release' to push the images to dockerhub and tag the repo
# 4) Change VERSION to tne next SHAPSHOT release: 35 -> 36-SNAPSHOT
# 5) Commit
# 6) Continue developing
# 7) `make snapshot' as needed to push snapshot images to dockerhub
